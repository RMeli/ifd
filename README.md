# Induced Fit Docking Dataset

Reconstruct (partial) data set used to validate Induced Fit Docking (IDF).

## Notes

Visually, the poses in structures `3pgh` and `1cx2` (chain `A`) do not appear to correspond to the ones in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.

Structures `1dba` and `1dm2` have been omitted on purpose because there is not ligand in the binding site.
